# Hello World! I'm Levent.
* I am a 21 years old Computer Science student. I am interested in areas such as System Programming, Artificial Intelligence and Reverse Engineering, and I include these topics in my blog posts. I am extremely interested in Linux and Open-Source Software. You can see, use and support my open source projects from the github link in the menu. You can also invite me to your projects, I'm always open to developing new things :)
