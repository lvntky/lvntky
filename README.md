# Hello World! I'm Levent.
* I am a 21 years old Computer Science student. I am interested in areas such as System Programming, Artificial Intelligence and Reverse Engineering, and I include these topics in my blog posts. I am extremely interested in Linux and Open-Source Software. You can see, use and support my open source projects from my repos. You can also invite me to your projects, I'm always open to developing new things :)
